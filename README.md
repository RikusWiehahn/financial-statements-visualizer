## Stonk Visualizer

This is a simple app that allows you to search for a stock via the yahoo finance API and visualize it's financial statements to understand the relationships between the fundamental metrics over time. Instead of staring at tables, you can easily see how each company's assets, liabilities revenue, expenses, and cash flow change over time - and how this is reflected in the market cap.
